# Algorithm Challenge #39 – Join Vector of Strings (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program joins a vector of strings into a single string using a custom separator.

Instead of reading input from the user, the vector is hard-coded to emphasize
the algorithmic logic of concatenation rather than input handling.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Iterating over vectors using range-based loops
- Dynamically building strings
- Handling separators during string concatenation
- Avoiding trailing delimiters in formatted output
- Writing reusable utility functions

---

🧩 Example
-
**Input Vector:**

["Mohammed", "Fahad", "Salim", "Alya"]


**Delimiter:**
" - "


**Output:**
Mohammed - Fahad - Salim - Alya
